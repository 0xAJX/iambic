### Set up a local Git repository

To get started with IAMbic, you need to create a local Git repository. This repository will store IAMbic templates for importing your cloud resources.
When you're ready to deploy IAMbic more broadly, create a [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).
GitHub is recommended because Noq provides [GitHub workflows](https://chat.openai.com/getting_started/github) that keep IAM identities and permissions
updated within your repository.

1. Open a terminal and run the following commands to create a new directory, initialize a Git repository, and set up a `.gitignore` file:

```bash
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates
git init
cat <<EOF > .gitignore
**/secrets.yaml
proposed_changes.yaml
env/
venv/
EOF
```

### Install IAMbic

1. Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install IAMbic:

```bash
pip install iambic-core
```

Please visit our [installation guide](/reference/installation/) for alternative installation methods.

### Configure AWS IAM credentials

Configure AWS credentials before running IAMbic. You can accomplish this by either setting environment variables with your credentials, setting an AWS_PROFILE, or another supported method.
Please reference the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more details.

We recommend using an AWS IAM identity (user or role) with administrative privileges
to use the Iambic Setup Wizard. A list of specific permissions is provided [here](/reference/aws_permissions_for_setup_wizard).

### Configuring IAMbic

Run `iambic setup` for a guided configuration process. This will create a `iambic_config.yaml` file in your current directory.

```bash
iambic setup
```

<AsciinemaWidget src="/recordings/iambic_setup.cast" rows={30} idleTimeLimit={3} preload={true} />


Alternatively, you can [create the configuration by hand](/how_to_guides/manually_create_the_configuration).


### Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed and configured, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve. You may configure any number of these identitiy providers to work with IAMbic.
