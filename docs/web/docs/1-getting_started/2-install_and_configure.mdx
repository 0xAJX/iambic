import AsciinemaWidget from '../../src/components/AsciinemaWidget';

### Prerequisites

Before starting the setup wizard, you will need the following information:

- Your AWS account ID(s)
- The ID of the AWS organization you wish to manage (if applicable)
- AWS IAM credentials with administrative privileges on the AWS account(s) you wish to manage
- An understanding of [AWS Hub and Spoke Roles](/reference/aws_hub_and_spoke_roles)

### Set up a local Git repository

To get started with IAMbic, create a local Git repository to store IAMbic templates for importing your cloud resources.
For production usage, a [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) is recommended
because IAMbic provides GitHub workflows that keep IAM identities and permissions updated within your repository.

1. Open a terminal and run the following commands to create a new directory, initialize a Git repository, and set up a .gitignore file:

```bash
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates
git init
cat <<EOF > .gitignore
**/secrets.yaml
proposed_changes.yaml
env/
venv/
EOF
```

### Install IAMbic

1. Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install IAMbic:

```bash
pip install iambic-core
```

Please visit our [installation guide](/reference/installation/) for alternative installation methods.

### Configure AWS IAM credentials

Before running IAMbic, configure your AWS credentials.
You can set environment variables with your credentials, set an AWS_PROFILE, or use another supported method.
Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)
for more details.

We recommend using an AWS IAM identity (user or role) with administrative privileges to use the Iambic
Setup Wizard. Refer to the list of [specific permissions](/reference/aws_permissions_for_setup_wizard)
required for the wizard.

### Configuring IAMbic

Run the following command to launch the Iambic Setup Wizard and configure IAMbic:

```bash
iambic setup
```

<AsciinemaWidget src="/recordings/iambic_setup.cast" rows={30} idleTimeLimit={3} preload={true} />

Alternatively, you can [create the configuration manually](/how_to_guides/manually_create_the_configuration).

### Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed and configured, you're ready to move on to the next steps.
Depending on your goals, you may configure IAMbic to work with any number of identity providers.
