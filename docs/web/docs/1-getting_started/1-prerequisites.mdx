Before getting started with IAMbic, make sure you have the following prerequisites
installed on your system.


## Operating system

Mac, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Git

1. Follow the instructions on the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to download and install Git on your operating system.

## Python

Python is required if you want to run IAMbic on your local machine, instead
of in a Docker container. This is the recommended way to run IAMbic.

1. Install Python 3.9+ ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

## AWS

AWS is required to run the Setup Wizard, as IAMbic uses AWS to create an AWS
Secrets Manager secret with sensitive information such as your Okta, Google,
and/or Azure AD credentials.

## Docker

Docker is only needed if you want to run IAMbic in a container.

1. Docker ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
1. Confirm Docker is installed properly:

```bash
docker run --rm busybox true
```
