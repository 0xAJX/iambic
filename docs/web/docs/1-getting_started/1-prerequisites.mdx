Before getting started with IAMbic, make sure you have the following prerequisites
and permissions:

## Operating system

Mac, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Git

1. Follow the instructions on the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to download and install Git on your operating system.

## Python

Python is required if you want to run IAMbic on your local machine, instead
of in a Docker container. This is the recommended way to run IAMbic.

1. Install Python 3.9+ ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

## Github CLI (Recommended)

IAMbic uses the Github CLI to simplify the process of creating repositories and a Github application. You can still
proceed without performing this step, but you will need to create repositories manually

1. [Install GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation)
2. [Authenticate GitHub CLI to Github](https://cli.github.com/manual/)

## AWS administrative access

Administrative access in AWS is required to run the Setup Wizard, as IAMbic leverages CloudFormation to create resources across your AWS Organization and/or accounts

## GitHub administrative access

IAMbic uses GitHub to store and version control your IAM. Administrative access to your GitHub organization is required to run the Setup Wizard, as this will
require the ability to create repositories and a Github application

## Docker (Optional)

Docker is only needed if you want to run IAMbic in a container.

1. Docker ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
1. Confirm Docker is installed properly:

```bash
docker run --rm busybox true
```
