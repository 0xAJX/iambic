### Configuring GitHub to work with IAMbic
These steps will guide you through the process of setting up an IAMOps/GitOps workflow using
GitHub Actions and an IAMbic Lambda function.

:::note

The instructions below leverage GitHub Action hosted runners. Github bills usage of action runners to the nearest full minute.
You can find more details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
To avoid being charged, you might consider using self-hosted runners. Alternatively, you can reduce the frequency of your IAMbic
action runs by changing their schedules after you have completed the setup process below.

## Overview
IAMbic's GitHub integration is designed to facilitate team collaboration on IAMbic templates.
This page will walk you through the steps of configuring IAMbic, GitHub, and AWS to work together.

### Compatible versions of Github

 * GitHub Free
 * GitHub Team
 * Github Enterprise Cloud

### The typical workflow for using IAMbic with GitHub

![IAMbic Git Flow](/img/git/iambic_git_flow.png)

1. Developer Alice wants to create an application role. She creates a different branch, makes her changes, and submits a pull request with her changes to the IAMbic templates repository.
2. Once the PR is created, the IAMbic GitHub action will run `iambic plan --git-aware` to calculate the changes required due to the PR, and submits the proposed changes back into the PR as a comment.
3. Reviewer Bob will review the template changes along with the proposed_changes. Bob may request additional changes.
4. Optional: Developer Alice updates the PR. The IAMbic GitHub action will run `iambic plan --git-aware` again to calculate the new changes required.
5. Reviewer Bob approves the PR.
6. Developer Alice comments with `iambic apply` in the PR.
7. The IAMbic GitHub action will apply the changes in the PR.
8. Once git-apply is successful, the GitHub action will close the pull request.

:::tip

If you'd like to use IAMbic in multiple AWS partitions (For example, AWS GovCloud, AWS China, and AWS Commercial),
you will need to create a separate IAMbic repository and GitHub App for each partition.

:::

## Setting up GitHub and AWS to work with IAMbic

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to do the following:

1. Complete the [IAMbic Getting Started guide](/getting_started/) to create your Git repository and import your existing identities and
permissions from your cloud provider(s).
2. Set up a GitHub repository for your IAMbic templates.
3. Make sure you have admin access for the IAMbic GitHub repository that can perform the following tasks:
	1. Configure the repository to require approvals before Merging Pull Requests.
	2. Add GitHub Apps
4. Have an AWS admin configure federated login <!-- #TODO link to how to configure federated login --> for IAMbic GitHub actions.


#### Configure your GitHub Repository to require approvals before merging

1. Go to the GitHub repository you had created previously, `ExampleOrg/iambic-templates`
2. Navigate to Repository Settings, in the left navigation menu to "Branches" settings page; the URL will look something like `github.com/ExampleOrg/iambic-templates/settings/branches`

![IAMbic Git Flow](/img/git/github-settings-menu.png)

3. Add a branch protection rule.
4. Set the branch name pattern to `main` (Or the name of your default branch, if it isn't `main`).
5. Configure the options
	1. Enable "Require a pull request before merging".
	1. Enable "Require Approvals".
	1. Leave the default value for "Required number of approvals".
	1. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging". <!-- #TODO Is there a reason the prior 3 settings were on one line and this was on it's own line?  -->


## GitHub App integration

By installing IAMbic GitHub App, the app can integrate the pull-request and merge flow in your iambic templates repository.

### Create a GitHub App in your organization

:::tip

Permission explanation
* repository contents read-and-write permission is to able to push to main for PR merging and periodic import cloud settings into repository.
* pull requests read-and-write permission is to able to update the branches when it turns relative time string into absolute time string.
* issue read-and-write permission is to write comments into pull requests during IAMbic plan and apply process.

:::

1. Modify `your_org_name` to your Github organization name and paste it into your browser.
```
https://github.com/organizations/your_org_name/settings/apps/new?name=iambic-integration-for-your_org_name&description=iambic-github-integration&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnoq.dev%2F&webhook_active=false&events[]=meta&events[]=issue_comment&&events[]=pull_request&contents=write&pull_requests=write&issues=write
```
2. Click "Create GitHub App".
3. Scroll down to "Private Keys".
4. Click "Generate a private key".
5. The private key should be downloaded automatically.


## Create an Additional GitHub Repository for IAMbic Plan and Apply Summaries

The IAMbic GitHub Application generates Plan and Apply Summaries for each pull request in your IAMbic templates repository.
These summaries provide an overview of the changes proposed by a pull request, and the results of applying those changes.
The IAMbic Github Application stores these summaries in a separate repository to allow for easier tracking and management,
and as it adds comments in each pull request, it provides a link to the summary in this separate repository.


1. **Create a new GitHub repository** in your organization that will host the IAMbic Plan and Apply Summaries.
   The repository must have the same name as your IAMbic templates repository, with `-gist` appended to the end.
   For example, if your repository name is `iambic-templates`, the new repository must be named `iambic-templates-gist`.

2. **Ensure the IAMbic GitHub App has write access to the new repository.
   - To set the repository permissions:
     1. Go to your organization settings (https://github.com/organizations/ExampleOrg/settings/profile).
     2. Select "GitHub Apps" under "Third-party Access" in the left navigation bar.
     3. Click "Configure" on "Iambic Integrations".
     4. Under "Repository access" section,
        ensure that both your IAMbic Templates repository, and the new repository you created in step 1 are selected.
     5. Click "Save".

### Store the following secrets in AWS Secrets Manager in the same AWS account running GitHub App lambda function.

1. Go to AWS Secret Manager, the URL will look like `console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/listsecrets`.
	1. Consider check the region, the default used in the Terraform is `us-west-2`.
1. Store the earlier downloaded private key contents (not the filename) in AWS Secrets Manager and name it `iambic/github-app-private-key`.
	1. This is the default name used in the Terraform that will be executed later. If you use another name, be sure to update it in the Terraform procedure later.

<!-- # TODO: Mention plaintext etc. -->

2. Generate a webhook secret by taking the output of one of these commands:
	1. `ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'`at the terminal.
	1. `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(20))"`
	1. `node -e "var token = require('crypto').randomBytes(20).toString('hex'); console.log(token)"`
3. Store the webhook secret in AWS Secrets Manager and name it `iambic/github-app-webhook-secret`.

### Create an IAM role for Lambda function execution
<!-- # TODO: Where do I put this file and how do I write it? -->

1. Place the above IAMbic template to your `iambic-templates` repo under `resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml`

:::tip

Remember to replace `TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID` with the actual account id literal. This account id is the account
id that deploys the lambda function.
:::

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
included_accounts:
  # You will need to replace the "TARGET_ACCOUNT_NAME"
  # with the account name of the AWS account can run compute and reasonably secured
  # because it is managing your infrastructure.
  # In the event you change the secret names, you need to update those values as well.
  - TARGET_ACCOUNT_NAME
identifier: iambic_github_app_lambda_execution
properties:
  description: Github App Lambda Execution
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          service: lambda.amazonaws.com
    version: '2012-10-17'
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: github-app
      statement:
        - action:
            - logs:CreateLogGroup
          effect: Allow
          resource:
            - "arn:aws:logs:*:{{var.account_id}}:log-group:*:log-stream:"
          sid: CreateLogGroup
        - action:
            - secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
          effect: Allow
          resource:
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-private-key
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-private-key-*
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-webhook-secret
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-webhook-secret-*
          sid: SecretReading
        - action:
            - logs:CreateLogStream
            - logs:PutLogEvents
          effect: Allow
          resource:
            - arn:aws:logs:*:{{var.account_id}}:log-group:/aws/lambda/iambic_github_app_webhook*:*
          sid: LogEvents
        - action: sts:AssumeRole
          effect: Allow
          resource: arn:aws:iam::{{var.account_id}}:role/IambicHubRole
      version: '2012-10-17'
  role_name: iambic_github_app_lambda_execution
```
2. You can then apply the template via `iambic apply resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml`
3. Allow the `iambic_github_app_lambda_execution` to assume to `IambicHubRole` in the organization management account.

:::tip

Remember to replace `TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID` with the actual account id literal. This account id is the account
id that deploys the lambda function.
:::

```diff
properties:
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
+      - sid: IambicGitHubIntegration
+        action:
+          - sts:AssumeRole
+          - sts:TagSession
+        effect: Allow
+        principal:
+          aws: arn:aws:iam::TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID:role/iambic_github_app_lambda_execution
```

Update the IambicHubRole by running `iambic apply <path-to-iambic-hub-role-of-mgmt-account>`

### Deploy the GitHub App as a Lambda Function

You have created the GitHub App. A GitHub App has to be a hosted application. Now, it will be deployed as a lambda function through a Terraform script.

1. Remember to set your `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable with your AWS account.
2. [Checkout iambic repository](/reference/installation/install_iambic_via_the_repo#checkout-the-iambic-repository).
3. `cd deployment/github_app`
4. `terraform init`
5. `terraform apply` (Examine the plan, it is the resources it will create). Enter `yes` if you accept the plan to continue.
6. `terraform output` will contain the lambda function URL. this is the URL to be used for the GitHub app webhook.

### Connect the GitHub App to the Lambda Function

Return to the GitHub App settings page to connect the GitHub App to the Lambda that was just deployed.

1. Go to `https://github.com/organizations/ExampleOrg/settings/apps/iambic-integrations`
2. Ensure you are in the "General" section in the left navigation bar.
3. Scroll down to "Webhook" section.
	1. Paste in the url from the lambda function URL. (e.g. "https://UNIQUE_ID.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws/").
	2. Paste in the Webhook secret generated earlier.
	3. Click "Save changes".
7. Click "Permissions & events" section in the left navigation bar.
	1. Scroll down to "Subscribe to events".
	2. Ensure the following are selected: "Meta", "Issue Comment", "Pull request", and "Workflow run".
	3. Click "Save changes".
11. Click "Install App" in the left navigation bar.
12. Click "Install" for your organization.
13. Go to your organization settings (https://github.com/organizations/ExampleOrg/settings/profile).
14. Select "GitHub Apps" under "Third-party Access" in the left navigation bar.
15. Click "Configure" on "Iambic Integrations".
16. Select your IAMbic templates repository under "Repository access" section.
17. Click Save.

### Enable iambic-integrations to bypass review rules for default branch


In the typical review flow for pull requests, approval from reviewers is necessary. However, certain actions like auto import or auto expiration
involve pushing changes back to the default branch without requiring manual approvals.

1. Go to your iambic templates repository settings (https://github.com/ExampleOrg/ExampleIambicTemplatesRepository/settings).
2. Click "Branches" in the top left navigation.
3. Click on "Edit" for your default branch (typically "main" or "master") under "Branch protection rules".
4. Click on "Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests".
5. In "Search for people, teams or apps", type in `iambic-integrations` to click on the GitHub App we have created.
6. Click "Save changes".

### Finish setting up your local repo


#### Open a pull request on your iambic-template repo

1. `default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')`
2. `git checkout -b task/change_description "$default_branch"`
3. Edit one of your description within your templates, like `resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml`. <!-- #TODO edit to what?? -->
4. Add your changes to your branch, and push it to github:
	```bash
	git add resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml
	git commit -m "Change Description"
	git push origin HEAD
	```
5. Create a pull request.
6. The installed GitHub App will comment with plan the changes. Any time you want iambic github action to re-plan the changes, you can comment `iambic plan`.
7. The plan will be a comment in line, as long as it is less than 65kb. Larger plans are uploaded to a gist and linked as a comment in the PR
8. Add reviewers to review your PR and plan that is in the PR comments.
9. Once your reviewer approves your changes, add comment `iambic apply` to have iambic apply the changes. If the changes can be successfully applied, the PR will be automatically merged into main as well.

<!--

## FAQ

1. The process of executing the plan and apply operations follows a merge workflow.
Initially, the default branch (usually  origin/main or origin/master) is checked out,
and the requested changes from the pull request are merged into it. This ensures that
the plan reflects the most current state. If conflicts arise at any point, the requester
should pull their default branch into the pull request branch and let the IAMbic GitHub
action replan the changes accordingly.
