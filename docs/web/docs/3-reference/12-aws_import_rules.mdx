title: AWS Import Rules
---

## Introduction and Motivation

IAMbic's import rules are a convenient way to control how IAMbic handles specific resources in your AWS environment.
There could be situations where you would want to tell IAMbic to:

- Completely IGNORE resources that are created and managed by certain systems or services such as AWS Identity Center (SSO).

- Set role templates to import_only if they are managed by another infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool, such as Terraform. This allows you to import and track
these resources within IAMbic without allowing users to change them through an IAMbic GitOps flow.

## Example configuration

You can configure IAMbic's import rules in the `aws.import_rules` configuration in the IAMbic's YAML configuration file.
Here is an example of how you might set up some import rules:

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_template_types:
        - "NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role"
      match_tags:
        - key: "terraform"
          value: "managed"
      action: "set_import_only"
    - match_template_types:
        - "NOQ::AWS::IdentityCenter::PermissionSet"
      action: "ignore"
```

In this example, the first rule tells IAMbic to set IAM Role templates (that are tagged with "terraform: managed") to import_only.
The second rule tells IAMbic to ignore all Permission Sets.

## Rule Processing Logic

Import rules are processed using an `AND` logic within a rule and `OR` logic across different rules.

This means that:

- Within a single rule, all conditions (match_template_types, match_tags, etc.) must be met for the rule to apply.
- Across different rules, if a resource matches any rule, the corresponding action will be taken, with ignore taking priority.

For example, if a resource matches the conditions of two rules, one with an action of ignore and the other with set_import_only,
the resource will be ignored by IAMbic.

## Supported Resource Types

The supported AWS resource types for the import rules in IAMbic are:

- IAM Roles
- IAM Users
- IAM Groups
- IAM Managed Policies
- AWS Identity Center (SSO) Permission Sets

## Examples of Rules

Here are some specific examples of import rules you might set:

1. Ignoring Specific Template Types:

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_template_types:
        - "NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role"
      action: "ignore"
```

2. Ignoring Specific Template Types if a Tag Matches:

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_template_types: ["NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role"]
      match_tags:
        - key: "Environment"
          value: "Production"
      action: "ignore"
```

3. Ignoring All Supported Templates with a Specific Tag Key, Regardless of Tag Value

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_tags:
        - key: "terraform"
      action: "ignore"
```

4. Ignoring All Supported Templates with a Specific Tag Key and Value:

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_tags:
        - key: "ManagedBy"
          value: "CDK"
      action: "ignore"
```

5. Ignoring All Supported Templates with a Specific Identifier Starting with a String:

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_names:
        - "AWSReservedSSO_*"
      action: "ignore"
```

6. Ignoring IAM Role Templates with Certain Paths

```yaml
aws:
  import_rules:
    - match_paths:
        - "/service-role/*"
        - "/aws-service-role/*"
      action: "ignore"
```

In these examples, the "ignore" action tells IAMbic not to manage these resources at all,
while the "set_import_only" action tells IAMbic to import these resources for tracking but not manage them.

The `match_template_types`, `match_tags`, `match_names`, and `match_paths` conditions allow you to specify the resources to which these actions apply.
