# AWS Hub and Spoke Roles

IAMbic uses a Hub-and-Spoke model to manage AWS resources. If you use AWS Organizations with IAMbic,
your AWS Organizations management account will serve as the Hub account. However, if you use individual AWS accounts,
you need to specify the account that will serve as the Hub account. In this case, IAMbic will create an
IambicHubRole on the Hub account and an IambicSpokeRole role on all of your AWS accounts. IambicSpokeRole will be
assumed by the IambicHubRole to perform actions on each respective account.

## Hub Role Permissions

The `IambicHubRole` should have permission to assume any IambicSpokeRole
in the environment, and to list all accounts in AWS Organizations.

See the [IambicHubRole Cloudformation template](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/plugins/v0_1_0/aws/cloud_formation/templates/IambicHubRole.yml)
for more details.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "organizations:ListAccounts",
        "organizations:ListTagsForResource"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sts:AssumeRole",
        "sts:TagSession",
        "sts:SetSourceIdentity"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

A note about why the resource value for `sts:AssumeRole` is `*`. IAMbicHubRole can be used to broker credentials. Since it does not know ahead of time what role to assume, the value is relaxed to `*`. However, this alone does not mean IAMbicHubRole can assume Role X without Role X granting it permission on RoleX's Trust Policy. Role assumption requires both subject (IambicHubRole) and object (Role X) to establish a mutual trust relationship.

To learn more about credential brokering, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html)

To learn more about Trust Policy, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html)

## Spoke Role Permissions

Each AWS account should have an IAMbicSpokeRole.
The IAMbic setup wizard will guide you in creating a Cloudformation StackSet to automatically configure each
account with this role.

See the [IambicSpokeRole Cloudformation template](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/plugins/v0_1_0/aws/cloud_formation/templates/IambicSpokeRole.yml)
for more details.

The IAMbicSpokeRole should have the following policy attached: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess`,
and the following permissions:


```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "identitystore:*",
        "organizations:describe*",
        "organizations:list*",
        "iam:*",
        "sso:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:describesecret",
        "secretsmanager:listsecrets",
        "secretsmanager:listsecretversionids",
        "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:iambic-config-secrets-*"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage",
        "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
        "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:IAMbicChangeDetectionQueue"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Read-Only Spoke Role permissions

If your initial evaluation requires a much more restrictive IAMbicSpokeRole, we do provide a CloudFormation
StackSet template to create IAMbicSpokeRoleReadOnly. The read only postfix only uses list, read capability of
`iam` and `sso` (aka IdentityCenter) services. However, in order for `iambic setup` to work, it keeps the
write ability to SecretManager resources prefixed with `iambic-config-secrets-`. This is necessary to keeps
track of other secrets used for other plugins. In addition, the write access to SQS is limited to queue
named `IAMbicChangeDetectionQueue` to monitor IAM resources changes.

The effect of using a read-only Spoke Role would be IAMbic can only handle one directional import from AWS.

You can either use `iambic setup` to instruct the initial setup to use a more restricted IAMbicSpokeRole or
directly change the IAMbic configuration to specify the arn of the spoke role.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "identitystore:Describe*",
        "identitystore:Get*",
        "identitystore:List*",
        "organizations:describe*",
        "organizations:list*",
        "iam:Get*",
        "iam:List*",
        "sso:Describe*",
        "sso:Get*",
        "sso:List*",
        "sso:Search*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:describesecret",
        "secretsmanager:listsecrets",
        "secretsmanager:listsecretversionids",
        "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:iambic-config-secrets-*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage",
        "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
        "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:IAMbicChangeDetectionQueue"
    }
  ]
}
