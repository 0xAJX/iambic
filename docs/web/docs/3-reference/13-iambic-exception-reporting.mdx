title: Handling and Reporting Unhandled Exceptions
---

## Overview
IAMbic's Exception Reporting is a built-in feature designed to report unexpected errors within the application. When an exception is raised,
this feature will automatically generate a report with relevant information about the incident, such as the nature of the exception, the segment
of the application being used when the error occurred, the specific action being executed, and other technical details crucial for troubleshooting.

You have the option to include variables in the report. We filter out variables that could potentially contain sensitive attributes (such as key, password, token, secret, etc).

Prior to the report submission, you will be given an opportunity to review and modify the report to be sent. You can optionally provide an email address
for us to reach out to you with updates, or you can modify the report according to your preferences.

By default, IAMbic is configured to prompt you to send an exception report whenever an error occurs during a tty (terminal) session.

This feature can be customized to suit your needs. You can set IAMbic to automatically send reports following an error, or you can
disable the feature entirely.

To adjust these settings, update the `iambic_config.yml` configuration file as follows:

```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: true|false
    include_variables: true|false
    automatically_send_reports: true|false
    email_address: your_email@example.com
```

## Configuration Examples

### Disabling Exception Reporting
```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: false
```

### Configuring Auto-reporting without Variables

```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: true
    automatically_send_reports: true
    include_variables: false
    email_address: your_email@example.com
```
### Configuring Auto-reporting with Variables

```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: true
    include_variables: true
    email_address: your_email@example.com
```
These examples demonstrate a variety of ways to customize the Exception Reporting feature, thereby facilitating smooth and personalized application use.
