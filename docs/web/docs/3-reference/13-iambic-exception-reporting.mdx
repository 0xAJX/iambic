title: Handling and Reporting Unhandled Exceptions
---

## Overview
IAMbic's Exception Reporting is a built-in feature designed to report unexpected errors within the application. When an exception is raised,
this feature will automatically generate a report with a stacktrace and other technical details that will help us troubleshoot the issue.

By default, IAMbic is configured to prompt you to send an exception report whenever an error occurs during a tty (terminal) session.

Prior to the report submission, you will be given an opportunity to review and modify the report to be sent. You can optionally provide an email address
for us to reach out to you with updates, or you can modify the report according to your preferences.

You have the option to include variables in the report, which is disabled by default. We strongly recommend that you keep this feature disabled, unless you are operating in
a test environment and are certain that no sensitive information will be included in a report. If you choose to enable this configuration, we filter out variables that
could potentially contain sensitive attributes (such as key, password, token, secret, private, etc), but it is your responsibility to review the report before
submitting.

This feature can be customized to suit your needs. You can set IAMbic to automatically send reports following an error, or you can
disable the feature entirely.

To adjust these settings, update the `iambic_config.yml` configuration file as follows:

```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: true|false
    include_variables: false # Do not enable this feature unless you are certain that no sensitive information will be included in the report
    automatically_send_reports: true|false
    email_address: your_email@example.com
```

## Configuration Examples

### Disabling Exception Reporting
```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: false
```

### Configuring Auto-reporting without Variables

```yaml
core:
  exception_reporting:
    enabled: true
    automatically_send_reports: true
    include_variables: false
    email_address: your_email@example.com
```

These examples demonstrate a variety of ways to customize the Exception Reporting feature, thereby facilitating smooth and personalized application use.
