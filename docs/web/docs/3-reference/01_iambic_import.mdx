title: Iambic Import Process
---
The `iambic import` command is used to import existing cloud resources into a human-readable, YAML format in Git.
The iambic import command is typically ran continually to ensure that your Git repository is kept up-to-date
with the actual state of your cloud environment.

In AWS, `iambic import` needs to be aware of your AWS accounts, because it will attempt to represent complex
multi-account resources into as few templates as possible. For example, if you have an engineering role
across multiple accounts, but with policies on the role that vary per account, `iambic import` will attempt
to represent this in a single template that identifies the differences. The same can be said for cloud identities
with various access rules per account.

When importing files using the iambic import command, IAMbic will overwrite the representation of a cloud identity in
Git with the updated representation of how that cloud resources looks in the cloud. If a conflict arises between the
imported file and the existing file, IAMbic will overwrite the existing file.

We are currently working on `IAMbic managed` mode, which would allow you to toggle IAMbic as the source of truth for
specific cloud identities. This would mean that any out-of-band changes to cloud identities would be reverted, if
those cloud identities are represented by an IAMbic template that is in `IAMbic managed` mode.

The iambic import command will intelligently retry when errors are recoverable,
such as rate limits. If the errors are not recoverable, IAMbic will raise an exception.
