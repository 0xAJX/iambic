IAMbic templates are declarative YAML files that allow you to define AWS IAM resources that span across multiple AWS accounts, and also define temporary access,
permissions, and resources.

IAMbic is a plugin-based system that allows you to define resources from other identity providers such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, and Google Workspace.
IAMbic templates are written in a syntax that resembles AWS CloudFormation to ease the learning curve. It is designed to be a standalone tool for reasoning with
and managing identity and access in a multi-provider environment.
