## Introduction

IAMbic, in a standard production deployment, periodically imports your cloud resources into Git, establishing an "eventually consistent" state
between your Git repository and your Cloud IAM. This process can be resource-intensive as it involves fetching all resources from the cloud,
comparing them to your existing IAMbic templates, and updating them if needed.

By default, this `import` operation runs every four hours
in a standard production deployment via GitHub using AWS EventBridge Rules

However, if you're like us, you'd want a more real-time reflection of your IAM in Git, desiring changes to be visible
soon after their occurrence. For AWS, this is achievable via AWS Change Detection. This feature utilizes AWS EventBridge and
SQS to promptly identify modifications to your IAM resources. IAMbic can be
invoked frequently to perform the inexpensive operation of reading an SQS queue, and refreshing the cloud resources that have changed.
By default, this action runs every 15 minutes. If you're using self-hosted runners, and have a normal IAM setup,
you should be able to run the detection flow every minute. Git would typically be updated with the actual state of your cloud IAM
within a few minutes of the change occurring.

## Understanding AWS Change Detection in IAMbic

AWS Change Detection operates by setting up a [Cloudformation Stack](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/plugins/v0_1_0/aws/cloud_formation/templates/IdentityRuleDestination.yml)
on your Organizational Management account. This stack is responsible for:

1. Establishing an EventBridge Event Bus for IAMbic, facilitating the receipt of messages from any other event bus within your organization.
2. Creating an EventBridge change detection rule that monitors create, update, and delete (CRUD) events on IAM or Identity Center resources.
3. Producing an SQS queue that acts as a target for receiving corresponding events.

In addition, IAMbic employs a [Cloudformation Stackset](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/plugins/v0_1_0/aws/cloud_formation/templates/IdentityRuleForwarder.yml)
to set up an EventBridge rule and an IAM role across *all other accounts* in your Organization. These keep track of CRUD events on IAM or Identity Center resources
on the respective account, and forward them to the Event Bus that was created on your Organizational Management account.

## Configuring AWS Change Detection

Setting up change detection with IAMbic is a straightforward process. Run the command `iambic setup` and choose
`Setup AWS change detection`. This option will only appear if you have previously configured an AWS Organization.

Executing this command will initiate the Cloudformation Stack and Stackset on your behalf,
effectively activating AWS Change Detection for your IAM resources.
