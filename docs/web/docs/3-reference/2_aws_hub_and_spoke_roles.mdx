# AWS Hub and Spoke Roles

IAMbic uses a Hub-and-Spoke model to manage AWS resources. If you use AWS Organizations with IAMbic,
your AWS Organizations management account will serve as the Hub account. However, if you use individual AWS accounts,
you need to specify the account that will serve as the Hub account. In this case, IAMbic will create an
IambicHubRole on the Hub account and an IambicSpokeRole role on all of your AWS accounts. IambicSpokeRole will be
assumed by the IambicHubRole to perform actions on each respective account.

## Hub Role Permissions

The `IambicHubRole` should have permission to assume any IambicSpokeRole
in the environment, and to list all accounts in AWS Organizations.

See the [IambicHubRole Cloudformation template](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/plugins/v0_1_0/aws/cloud_formation/templates/IambicHubRole.yml)
for more details.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "organizations:ListAccounts",
        "organizations:ListTagsForResource"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sts:AssumeRole",
        "sts:TagSession"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Spoke Role Permissions

Each AWS account should have an IAMbicSpokeRole.
The IAMbic setup wizard will guide you in creating a Cloudformation StackSet to automatically configure each
account with this role.

See the [IambicSpokeRole Cloudformation template](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/plugins/v0_1_0/aws/cloud_formation/templates/IambicSpokeRole.yml)
for more details.

The IAMbicSpokeRole should have the following policy attached: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess`,
and the following permissions:


```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "identitystore:*",
        "organizations:describe*",
        "organizations:list*",
        "iam:*",
        "sso:*",
        "secretsmanager:CreateSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
