Template Language
-----------------

To use IAMbic's powerful templatizing feature, simply use the double curly bracket style to reference attributes in the XXX object.

For instance, if the aim is to create a role and apply it to all accounts, you can write a role definition as follows:

```
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: '{{account_name}}_readonly'
properties:
  description: Standard ReadOnly Role
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action:
          - sts:AssumeRole
          - sts:TagSession
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          aws: arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:role/IambicHubRole
      - action:
          - sts:AssumeRole
          - sts:TagSession
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          aws: arn:aws:iam::4567890123456:role/NoqCentralRoleCorpNoqDev
    version: '2012-10-17'
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: '{{account_name}}_readonly'
  tags:
    - key: noq-tra-supported-groups
      value: noq_admins@noq.dev

```

In the above example we are utilizing the {{account_name}} place holder to dynamically set the identifier and role_name fields with each account
that is managed by IAMbic. If there are 10 accounts managed by IAMbic, this role would exist in all ten accounts.
