title: Git Flow
---

Git flow is a Git repository management and organization framework that is
based on two primary branches: the master branch, representing a stable version of
the software, and the development branch, used for ongoing development and testing.
Feature branches are created from the development branch to work on specific changes,
and once completed, the changes are merged back into the development branch. Release
branches are used to prepare for new releases, and hotfix branches are used to
address critical bugs or security vulnerabilities. Git flow provides a structured
process for managing the development lifecycle, facilitating collaboration and
efficient release management.

IAMbic utilizes Git's branch lifecycle and commit history to generate a change
record, allowing it to understand changes immediately without expensive cloud requests.
By using Git flow and the Git system, IAMbic can quickly identify deltas based on
locally available metadata that is continuously updated with a central cloud repository.
As long as a previous commit exists, IAMbic can reference it to understand the changes
to be made, without needing to query the cloud.
