title: Git Flow
---

Git flow is a branching model and a set of guidelines for managing and organizing Git repositories. It was introduced by Vincent Driessen in 2010 as a way to address common issues in software development, such as collaboration, release management, and maintenance. The Git flow model is based on two main branches: the master branch and the development branch. The master branch represents the stable, production-ready version of the software, while the development branch is used for ongoing development and testing. Developers create feature branches off the development branch to work on specific features or changes. Once a feature is completed, it is merged back into the development branch, which is continuously integrated and tested. When the development branch reaches a stable state, it is merged into the master branch, and a new release is created.

Git flow also defines several other types of branches, including release branches, which are used to prepare for a new release by stabilizing the code and fixing any issues, and hotfix branches, which are used to quickly address critical bugs or security vulnerabilities in the master branch. The Git flow model provides a clear structure and process for managing the development lifecycle of a software project, making it easier for teams to collaborate and ensure that code changes are properly tested and integrated. It also allows for more efficient release management, as releases are prepared on stable release branches rather than the development branch.

IAMbic relies on the lifecycle of a branch with all of it's commits to generate a record of change. Any deviation from the system of record requires a git commit in order for IAMbic to understand the difference in the deviation, without using countless of expensive cloud requests to gather that information. Using git flow and the git system allows IAMbic to understand deltas immediately, based on locally available metadata that is kept up-to-date with a central cloud repository.

This provides a challenge: an account change does not take effect until a git commit can be used to determine the difference of the current change. This means that all changes must first be committed, before they are applied. IAMbic will skip any change requests modifying the system of record that do not have a change record. A change record is comprised of two differing commits that indicate a change is needed.
