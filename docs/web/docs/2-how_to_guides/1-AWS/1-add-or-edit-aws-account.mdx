title: Adding or editing AWS accounts in your IAMbic config
---

> Account in this document references any provider that you want to manage with IAMbic.
> For example, an AWS Account, Google Workspace, or an Okta Organization.

## Overview
To add or edit accounts in your IAMbic config simply use the wizard.
Run `iambic setup` command to launch the Setup Wizard.

Using the wizard is crucial to ensure your IAMbic config is valid, secrets are written correctly, and templates are properly synced.

## Adding an account
When you add an account through the wizard, in addition to updating your config, your templates will be synced.

### What happens when my templates are synced?
When you add an account, any templates that apply to the new account are created on the account.
The exception to this is if the resource already exists on the account or `iambic_managed` is not set to `read_and_write`.

For example, if you have a template that creates the IAM role `engineering` in all accounts, that role will be created on the new account.
However, if the `engineering` role already exists on the new account, it will not be overwritten.
If you have another IAM role template called `qa-intern` to be deployed in all accounts, and it does not exist on the new account, it will be created.

After templates are applied to the new account, IAMbic will run an import to pull in all resources unique to that account if `iambic_managed` is not set to `disabled`.

## Updating an account
> NOTE: An AWS account assigned to an AWS organization CANNOT be updated through the wizard.
> Any changes to an AWS organization account should be done in the AWS console.
> Once the change has been made it will be picked up by the GitHub config discovery job or can be pulled in manually by running the command `iambic config-discovery`.

When you add an account through the wizard, in addition to updating your config, your templates will be synced.

### What happens when my templates are synced?

When you update an account through the wizard, in addition to updating your config, your templates will be synced  if `iambic_managed` is not set to `disabled` for the account.

Updating an account is much more straightforward than adding an account.
Once the config has been updated, IAMbic will run an import to refresh the representation of the resources for the account.
The primary purpose of this is to update any interpolation in your templates.

For example, if you have a template that creates an IAM role with the account name in the role name, updating the account name will update the way the role name is represented in your template.
If the account was named `service-tm` and it was updated to `service-team` and a role exists with the name `qa-service-team-role`, the role name would be updated to `qa-{{account_name}}-role` in the template.
